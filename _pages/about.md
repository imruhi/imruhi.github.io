Hello! My name is Ruhi! I was born in July 2001 in Mumbai, India and I am a first year PhD student at the University of Groningen in the Computational Linguistics aka GroNLP group. My supervisors are [Tommaso Caselli](https://www.rug.nl/staff/t.caselli/?lang=en), [Andreas van Cranenburgh](https://andreasvc.github.io/) and [Malvina Nissim](https://malvinanissim.github.io/). In my PhD, I am part of the [HAICu consortium](https://www.haicu.science/). For it, I aim to develop text understanding models through neurosymbolic AI and transfer learning techniques to capture socio-cultural language-transmitted aspects of past times in the Netherlands, with a particular focus on past scenarios for which only sparse data exists, for example working towards uncovering under-represented perspectives from marginalised groups in cultural heritage data. 

I recieved my bachelor's (Artificial Intelligence, 2019-2022) and master's (Artificial Intelligence, 2022-2024) from University of Groningen. Here are my [bachelor's thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oSRN9xZcjLsdhZh2pqhlr2z5Dzzw6T1j/view?usp=sharing) and [master's thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_TV80mCphJgkkG6qH-nlYFmA7wL5cTL2/view?usp=sharing). 

My general interest is in using artificial intelligence technologies to improve and simplify the lives of people. I am also interested in languages which are not often represented in traditional research in natural language processing and computational linguistics. Previously I have also worked on language modeling and developing LLM's as communication aids for language disorders.

My personal interests are knitting, cycling, eating good food and going on walks with the sole pu(u)rpose of petting cats! Music is a big part of my life and I love listening to electronic music in general as I have yet to determine which sub-genre(s) I like best. My favourite song is [Veridis Quo](https://youtu.be/HhZaHf8RP6g?si=SgXwFIDGtKrcLPop) by Daft Punk.
